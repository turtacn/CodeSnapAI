# jules Integration Guide

This guide explains how to use the CodeSage governance feature with jules, an AI-powered code assistant.

## Overview

The CodeSage governance feature can be used to generate a list of tasks for improving a codebase. These tasks can then be fed to jules to automatically generate code patches.

## Workflow

1. Generate a project snapshot using the `codesage snapshot create` command.
2. Generate a governance plan using the `codesage governance-plan` command.
3. Select a task from the governance plan.
4. Use the `jules_bridge` to generate a jules-friendly task view.
5. Feed the task view to jules.
6. jules will generate a code patch.
7. Review and apply the code patch.

## jules Task View

The `jules_bridge` generates a jules-friendly task view that contains the following information:

- `file_path`: The path to the file that the task is associated with.
- `language`: The programming language of the file.
- `line`: The line number of the issue.
- `function_name`: The name of the function that the issue is in.
- `issue_message`: A human-readable description of the issue.
- `goal_description`: A description of the goal of the task.
- `code_snippet`: A snippet of the code that the issue is in.
- `llm_hint`: A hint from the LLM on how to fix the issue.
- `notes_for_human_reviewer`: A note to the human reviewer.

## Constraints

- jules should not be used to make architectural decisions.
- jules should not be used to modify CI/CD pipelines.
- All code patches generated by jules should be reviewed by a human.
