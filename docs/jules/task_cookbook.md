# Jules Task Cookbook

This document provides a cookbook of recipes for common refactoring tasks using Jules.

## Simplifying High-Complexity Functions

*   **Input**: A Jules prompt generated for a high-complexity function.
*   **Expected Output**: A refactored version of the function with reduced complexity, along with an explanation of the changes.
*   **Human Review**: Verify that the refactored code is correct, readable, and maintains the original functionality.

## Adding Type Hints and Error Handling to HTTP Handlers

*   **Input**: A prompt to add type hints and error handling to an HTTP handler.
*   **Expected Output**: The function signature updated with type hints, and error handling logic added to the function body.
*   **Human Review**: Ensure that the type hints are correct and the error handling is appropriate for the application.

## Making Shell Scripts More Robust

*   **Input**: A prompt to make a shell script more robust.
*   **Expected Output**: The script will be modified to include `set -euo pipefail` and other best practices.
*   **Human Review**: Check that the script still functions as expected and that the changes have not introduced any unintended side effects.
