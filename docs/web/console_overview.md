# CodeSage Web Console Overview

The CodeSage web console provides a browser-based interface for viewing and analyzing code analysis reports and governance plans. It's designed to be a lightweight, read-only tool that helps you visualize the state of your codebase without modifying it.

## Architecture

The web console is built on a simple, decoupled architecture:

-   **Backend**: A FastAPI server that provides a RESTful API for accessing project data. It reads data from YAML and JSON files generated by the CodeSage CLI.
-   **Frontend**: A static single-page application (SPA) that consumes the backend API and presents the data in an interactive way.

## Organization View

The web console also includes an organization-level dashboard that provides a high-level overview of all projects configured in your `.codesage.yaml` file.

### Features

-   **Project List**: A sortable and filterable list of all projects, with key health metrics at a glance.
-   **Health Score**: A calculated score that represents the overall health of each project.
-   **Risk and Issue Counts**: The number of high-risk files and open issues for each project.
-   **Regression Status**: An indicator that highlights projects with recent regressions.

### Switching to the Org View

To access the organization view, simply navigate to the root URL of the web console. The organization dashboard is the default view. You can then click on a project to drill down into the detailed project-level view.

## Security

The web console is designed to be a read-only tool. It does not provide any functionality for modifying code, running CI/CD pipelines, or making any other changes to the project. It is recommended to run the web console in a trusted environment.
